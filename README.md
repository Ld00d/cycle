# Cycle 

Cycle is a collection of modules that will eventually comprise a full product development suite.

## Hub

The Hub is the central point of user information. It handles registration and authentication of users for the other parts of Cycle.

## Spokes

Spokes is essentially a forum software with an API to allow other parts of Cycle to read/write from. One could set up an instance of Spokes on its own (with Hub) as a stand-alone forum.

## Frame 

Frame is where products are described and where issues/bugs are tracked. Items in Frame are accompanied by Spokes topics for communication.

## Bars

Bars is where progress on Frame items are tracked.
